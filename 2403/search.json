This includes concepts like: Learning Organisations vs Organisational Learning, and Organisational learning vs Knowledge management. We will also talk about how knowledge is stored in an organisation (“Knowledge retention”), what supports organisational learning at macro level (such as Garvins “Building Blocks”), as well as how to measure an organisations level of learning. Apart from this we will adress group level learning, including concepts from management and leadership theory, such as basic group dynamics, the difference between group and a team, and look at different learning activities that support meso level learning."

    "text": "How do we build a collaborative and innovative workplace?\nIn the first offering of this two-day course in Organizational Learning, learn how we can adapt and improve as an organization through gathering, sharing, and applying knowledge. This course goes beyond individual skill development to building organizational culture and structure. Through creating and utilizing organizational processes that foster collective learning and development, we can achieve the workplace we want.\nThe lectures, discussions, and exercises of this course will teach foundational principles and theories of Organizational Learning, including concepts on organizational knowledge, knowledge management, and workplace training. We will also give you practical tools and sustainable strategies you can apply beyond the course—such as how to enhance learning at all levels, from the individual (micro level), to group/team (meso level) and organization (macro level).\nWe welcome managers, coordinators, and leaders from all career stages to learn how to build a workplace culture of continuous learning in a resource-friendly way using organizational knowledge and collective intelligence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, participants should be able to:\n\nexplain key concepts in Organisational Learning, and how these relate to culture, leadership and organisational processes.\nidentify similarities and differences between individual learning, group learning and organisational learning\nidentify workplace learning activities, and recognize how these can be designed to create additional organisational value\nidentify barriers and promoters for knowledge dissemination and organisational learning"
