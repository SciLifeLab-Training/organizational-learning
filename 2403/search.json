This course goes beyond individual skill development to building organizational culture and structure. Through creating and utilizing organizational processes that foster collective learning and development, we can achieve the workplace we want.\nThe lectures, discussions, and exercises of this course will teach foundational principles and theories of Organizational Learning, including concepts on organizational knowledge, knowledge management, and workplace training. We will also give you practical tools and sustainable strategies you can apply beyond the course—such as how to enhance learning at all levels, from the individual (micro level), to group/team (meso level) and organization (macro level).\nWe welcome managers, coordinators, and leaders from all career stages to learn how to build a workplace culture of continuous learning in a resource-friendly way using organizational knowledge and collective intelligence!",
